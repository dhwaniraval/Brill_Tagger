WASHINGTON
--
Five
years
ago
officials
at
the
Savannah
River
nuclear
weapons
plant
near
Aiken
,
S.C.
,
dedicated
a
nearly
completed
first-of-a-kind
factory
for
transforming
highly
radioactive
liquid
wastes
into
a
solid
form
suitable
for
safe
storage
.
But
the
plant
,
the
Defense
Waste
Processing
Facility
,
which
was
originally
supposed
to
have
opened
in
1989
,
has
yet
to
begin
operating
,
and
the
cost
of
building
and
preparing
it
for
operations
has
risen
to
$
2
billion
,
from
the
$
910
million
that
was
forecast
when
the
project
began
in
1983
.
A
similar
plant
under
construction
at
West
Valley
,
N.Y.
,
near
Buffalo
,
has
also
run
into
trouble
.
And
the
energy
department
has
delayed
construction
of
a
third
plant
,
at
the
Hanford
Nuclear
Reservation
,
near
Richland
,
Wash.
,
where
millions
of
gallons
of
waste
have
leaked
.
Now
,
officials
say
,
the
Savannah
River
plant
will
finally
go
into
operation
,
starting
the
decades-long
task
of
encasing
the
liquid
wastes
in
glass
to
sharply
cut
the
threat
they
pose
.
Department
officials
said
that
they
had
expected
some
shakeout
problems
but
asserted
that
the
plant
was
close
to
opening
.
Once
the
plant
is
operating
,
it
will
take
about
30
years
to
empty
51
underground
tanks
that
variously
hold
750,000
gallons
to
1.3
million
gallons
each
of
waste
generated
by
the
process
of
making
bombs
and
the
fuel
for
submarine
reactors
.
But
last
month
the
department
decided
to
run
a
chemical-processing
plant
at
Savannah
River
to
change
the
chemical
form
of
several
tons
of
nuclear
material
--
spent
military
reactor
fuel
originally
intended
to
be
mined
for
its
bomb-grade
plutonium
--
that
is
in
corroding
containers
.
The
inspection
team
went
back
to
Washington
,
not
to
return
for
a
month
or
so
,
until
what
it
called
the
plant
's
``
emergent
equipment
problems
''
were
fixed
.
Brian
Costner
of
the
Energy
Research
Foundation
,
a
South
Carolina
environmental
group
,
said
the
problems
raised
questions
about
the
department
's
management
and
the
way
the
plant
was
built
.
So
say
Doug
Butcher
and
numerous
other
Fort
Worth-area
fishermen
who
have
been
braving
the
cold
weather
to
fish
the
warm
waters
of
the
Comanche
Peak
nuclear
power
plant
lake
.
``
Ever
since
they
cranked
up
the
second
unit
at
the
power
plant
,
this
lake
has
gotten
better
,
''
said
Butcher
,
a
former
professional
rodeo
bull
riding
and
steer
wrestling
champion
and
now
one
of
the
top
professional
bass
fishing
competitors
on
the
Anglers
Choice
and
B.A.S.S
.
The
warm
water
that
the
power
plant
discharges
into
the
lake
has
made
Squaw
Creek
one
of
the
most
popular
bass
fishing
lakes
in
North
Texas
,
but
that
has
happened
only
since
the
second
unit
became
operational
.
To
catch
Squaw
Creek
bass
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
Butcher
said
,
he
uses
tactics
similar
to
those
he
uses
on
non-power
plant
lakes
during
other
times
of
the
year
when
their
water
conditions
are
similar
.

acquire

The
Canton
facility
served
as

when

the

shut

acted
at
the
same
time
that
the
agency
's
inspector
general
,
an
independent
investigator
established
by

,
concluded
that
the
Millstone
1
power
plant
had
been
unloading
nuclear
fuel
from
its
reactor
all
at
once
,
though
its
license
called
for
partial
unloading
.
At
another
New

power
plant
,
Maine
Yankee
in
Wiscasset
,
Maine
,
an
anonymous
whistleblower
has
charged
that
the
NRC
failed
to
enforce
safety
regulations
.
The
concern
arises
when
a
nuclear
power
plant
is
refueled
.
But
until
then
,
since
the
plant
began
operating
in
the
1970s
,
its
operating
license
had
demanded
a
partial
unloading
--
no
more
than
a
third
of
the
core
at
one
time
.
The
NRC
has
beefed
up
its
inspection
staff
at
Millstone
and
told
the
plant
that
before
it
its
can
return
to
service
,
expected
next
month
,
it
must
provide
updated
safety
information
.
The
announcement
produced
a
roar
of
applause
and
shouts
from
the
crowd
of
workers
who
had
filed
into
the
former
Honeywell-Bull
plant
here
for
a
meeting
on
their
fate
.
The
investigation
helped

In
meetings
with
Energy
Department
officials
in
Amarillo

Texas

Washington
,
the
Government
Accountability
Project
has
alleged
that
the
45-year-old
plant
,
whose
primary
mission
is
to
dismantle
nuclear
weapons
,
operates
in
a
haphazard
,
unsafe
manner
.
Now
,
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
plant
,
at
least
30
insiders
have
come
forward
to
reveal
that
a
culture
of
cover-ups
pervades
the
plant
,
hiding
ongoing
unsafe
occurrences
,
according
to
the
Government
Accountability
Project
.
With
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
,
the
Pantex
plant
has
become
the
hub
of
the
nation
's
disarmament
program
.
The
plant
operates
on
a
$
268
million
annual
budget
.
The
Energy
Department
and
its
contractor
,
Mason
&
Hanger-Silas
Mason
Inc.
,
which
has
operated
the
plant
since
1956
,
acknowledge
there
have
been
procedural
breaches
at
the
plant
.
Quarterly
reviews
of
the
plant
by
the
Energy
Department
's
Albuquerque
Field
Office
confirm
many
of
the
procedural
and
safety
violations
raised
by
the
Government
Accountability
Project
,
but
say
they
are
being
corrected
.
The
Fort
Worth
Star-Telegram
obtained
three
reviews
from
the
period
covering
1992-1994
;
in
those
,
the
department
awarded
the
plant
quarterly
bonuses
ranging
from
$
1
million
to
$
2
million
.
``
If
a
case
is
filed
against
the

,
we
will
certainly
address
it

O'Neal
said

solvents

machinery
inside

O'Neal
,
a
former
shop
steward
for

Metal
Trades

said
improperly
manufactured
bolts
have
n't
passed
weight
tests
and
can
give
way
.
``

found

information

Tom
Williams

The

counts
the
number
of
tritium
bottles
on

should
also
weigh
the
bottles
to
detect
how
much
gas
may
have
decayed
or
escaped
during
dismantlement

letter
says
.
Throughout
the
Cold
War
,
the
plant
's
operations
were
top
secret
.
In
the
post-Cold

continued
secrecy

Fairfax

conduct

underwent

PDVSA
President
Luis
Giusti
said
in
remarks
during
a
Venezuelan-American
Chamber
of
Commerce
conference
.
He
said
he
got
lucrative
job
offers
when
he
retired
at
age
45
from
the
Navy
in
1994
,
but
he
passed
them
up
to
run
a
sewer
plant
on
the
Ohio
River
near
his
hometown
.
But
when
Charvat
took
over
the
Eastern
Ohio
Regional
Wastewater
Authority
plant
in
Belmont
County
in
July
1994
,
he
found
the
mundane
utility
was
harboring
foul
secrets
.
Charvat
said
that
before
his
arrival
,
the
plant
secretly
dumped
millions
of
gallons
of
raw
sewage
into
the
Ohio
River
.
The
plant
,
one
of
the
largest
on
the
Ohio
side
of
the
river
,
also
failed
to
fix
long-broken
and
malfunctioning
equipment
.
Charvat
said
he
tried
to
improve
operations
but
his
efforts
were
resisted
by
plant
employees
and
trustees
,
who
fired
him
in
September
.
``
We
've
come
a
long
way
,
''
said
Paul
Pollock
,
one
of
two
longtime
sewer
workers
who
have
run
the
plant
since
Charvat
's
ouster
.
The
plant
opened
in
1964
.
In
1974
,
federal
and
state
clean-water
regulations
required
the
plant
to
draw
up
a
secondary
treatment
plan
,
which
would
result
in
cleaner
water
going
into
the
river
.
Pollock
conceded
the
plant
was
``
limping
along
''
without
the
pure-oxygen
system
,
but
he
said
it
was
meeting
water-discharge
regulations
.
Thus
,
he
said
,
the
trustees
did
n't
do
anything
to
upgrade
the
plant
.
But
instead
of
levying
fines
,
prosecuting
plant
officials
or
revoking
their
licenses
,
the
agency
only
wrote
threatening
letters
to
trustees
.
In
a
1987
letter
,
the
Ohio
EPA
noted
the
plant
already
had
a
history
of
not
reporting
clean-water
violations
.
The
tip
prompted
the
Ohio
EPA
,
with
help
from
the
state
attorney
general
's
office
,
to
investigate
the
plant
that
year
.
The
plant
had
illegally
dumped
sewage
into
the
river
and
solid
waste
on
the
river
bank
,
failed
to
notify
the
agency
of
equipment
breakdowns
and
failed
to
test
waste-water
discharges
,
Ohio
EPA
records
state
.

'

and
the
son
of
another
trustee
,
Belmont
County
Democratic
Party
Chairman
Jim
Tekely
,
also
is
a
sewer
employee
.
The
fact
that
he
'd
never
worked
in
a
sewer
plant
-
or
even
visited
the
Belmont
County
plant
before
his
first
day
on
the
job
-
did
n't
bother
him
.
He
,
for
example
,
embarked
on
a
crash
course
to
get
his
state
license
to
operate
the
plant
.
Charvat
even
posted
the
Ohio
EPA

toll-free
number
and
invited
plant
employees
to
directly
report
any
violations
.
``
All
of
a
sudden
,
I
had
much
better
communication
with
the
plant
,
''
Ohio
EPA
's
Abbot
Stevenson
said
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
too
,
the
plant
began
reporting
water-discharge
violations
that
never
showed
up
under
Vannelle
's
leadership
.
Charvat
's
critics
said
it
was
because
he
was
clueless
about
how
to
run
a
sewer
plant
.
Charvat
said
it
was
because
,
for
the
first
time
in
the
plant
's
history
,
somebody
was
accurately
reporting
discharge
data
.
According
to
senior
plant
employees
,
some
of
whom
Charvat
said
wanted
his
job
,
Charvat
was
in
over
his
head
,
hired
strictly
because
of
his
Thomas
family
connection
.
``
We
were
a
lost
plant
for
a
year
,
''
Pollock
said
of
Charvat
's
reign
.
The
plant
's
trustees
admit
there
are
problems
:
Their
consultant
said
it
will
cost
$
4
million
to
bring
the
plant
into
conformity
with
environmental
law
and
urged
the
trustees
to
start
upgrading
in
the
spring
.
But
the
trustees
said
that
one
of
the
plant
's
biggest
problems
was
Charvat
.
Since
Charvat
's
departure
,
the
plant
has
had
fewer
violations
.
Tom
Morgan
,
a
laboratory
technician
at
the
plant
,
said
he
was
dismayed
by
Charvat
's
inexperience
:
``
He
said
he
'd
visited
some
-LRB-
sewer
-RRB-
plants
before
he
arrived
.
Pollock
and
Morgan
said
Charvat
would
n't
allow
them
to
continue
long-standing
practices
that
kept
the
plant
running
without
violations
.
For
instance
,
he
interfered
with
the
hauling
of
sludge
,
causing
sludge
to
back
up
at
the
plant
,
they
said
.
``
The
problem
was
,
he
just
retired
after
20
years
in
the
Navy
and
he
must
have
thought
he
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
$
600
toilet
seats
,
''
said
Bob
Warner
,
who
now
runs
the
plant
with
Pollock
.
He
said
he
got
a
chilly
reception
from
jealous
senior
employees
Pollock
and
Warner
,
who
``
sabotaged
''
his
attempts
at
reforming
the
plant
with
their
``
passive-aggressive
''
behavior
,
telling
lies
about
him
to
other
workers
and
stirring
up
resentment
.
The
new
superintendent
presented
the
trustees
with
a
seven-page
memo
outlining
his
views
on
what
was
wrong
with
the
plant
and
how
he
'd
fix
it
.
It
led
off
with
a
quote
from
economist
John
Maynard
Keynes
-
``
The
difference
lies
not
with
the
new
ideas
,
but
in
escaping
the
old
ones
''
-
and
ended
with
a
call
for
a
``
revolution
''
at
the
sewer
plant
.
In
an
affidavit
he
filed
with
the
U.S.
Department
of
Labor
after
his
firing
,
Charvat
said
Stevenson
told
him
in
December
1994
that
the
Ohio
EPA
planned
to
review
the
plant
's
environmental
problems
.
The
same
day
,
the
trustees
appointed
Pollock
and
Warner
as
the
new
plant
co-superintendents
.
They
have
taken
out
a
full-page
ad
in
a
local
newspaper
detailing
the
plant
's
shortcomings
,
previously
unknown
to
the
public
.
He
remains
so
deeply
suspicious
about
state
oversight
of
the
plant
that
he
has
refused
a
request
from
the
Ohio
attorney
general
's
office
to
discuss
his
complaints
.
Indeed
,
answers
on
why
the
plant
was
not
referred
to
the
attorney
general
earlier
are
hard
to
come
by
.
Trustee
Wilson
told
concerned
audience
members
,
``
we
drink
the
same
water
you
do
,
''
and
rhetorically
asked
why
the
trustees
would
n't
run
a
clean
plant
.
The
Ohio
River
's
water
,
even
without
the
Belmont
County
plant
's
discharges
,
is
often
hazardous
,
according
to
the
Ohio
River
Valley
Water
Sanitation
Commission
in
Cincinnati
.
From
1992
to
date
,
bacteria
levels
upstream
from
the
plant
were
so
high
,
people
risked
intestinal
disorders
if
they
swallowed
river
water
.
A.
Speaking
of
islands
,
I
am
reminded
of
the
Greek
proverb
that
I
quote
in
my
No.

nonfiction
best-selling
book
which
I
wrote
myself
:
A
civilization
flourishes
when
people
plant
trees
under
whose
shade
they
will
never
sit
.
``
This
25-megawatt
plant
operated
very
well
this
fall
,
and
we
have
no
reason
it
wo
n't
go
back
on
line
again
.
In
November
,
the
availability
of
the
plant
was
over
94
percent
,
and
in
December
it
was
96
percent

Cantrail
Berry
recalls
the
day
Rossco
Johnson
showed
up
at
the
Sanderson
Farms
chicken
processing
plant
,
driving
a
shiny
black
,
souped-up
pickup
truck
with
a
throaty
Floatmaster
muffler
,
chrome-plated
wheels
and
the
Laborers
'
International
Union
of
North
America
logo
painted
in
gold
on
the
doors
.
After
30
days
of
furtive
,
one-on-one
organizing
,
Johnson
had
persuaded
Berry
,
24
,
and
some
of
his
friends
to
organize
a
labor
union
at
the
Sanderson
plant
in
Collins
,
and
then
here
in
Hazlehurst
.
The
July
vote
in
Sanderson
's
Collins
plant
was
breathtakingly
close
,
with
17
votes
spelling
union
victory
.
It
was
only
in
October
,
after
the
union
successfully
organized
the
Sanderson
plant
here
in
Hazlehurst
,
that
management
came
to
the
bargaining
table
.
Negotiations
produced
a
new
contract
paying
$
6.90
an
hour
to
one-year
employees
,
making
the
Sanderson
workers
the
highest-paid
processing
plant
workers
in
Mississippi
.
Last
December
's
vote
at
Tyson
's
plant
in
Canton
,
Miss.
,
failed
by
a
2-to-1
margin
.
Another
,
at
a
Perdue
plant
in
Dothan
,
Ala.
,
failed
amid
union
accusations
of
management-inspired
cross
burnings
aimed
at
intimidating
black
workers
.
In
December
at
a
newly
purchased
plant
in
Canton
,
Tyson
faced
down
its
most
recent
union
challenge
.
``
That
's
why
we
needed
the
Hazlehurst
plant
organized
,
''
he
said
.
It
was
a
different
story
50
miles
to
the
north
,
at
the
Tyson
plant
in
Canton
,
where
employees
soundly
defeated
the
union
by
a
2-to-1
margin
in
December
.
Workers
like
Dottie
Spencer
,
who
is
29
,
said
they
had
tired
of
fighting
the
plant
's
previous
owner
,
McCarty
Farms
,
which
had
fought
the
unions
through
the
courts
.
So
when
Tyson
bought
the
plant
last
year
,
just
as
a
new
union
vote
was
scheduled
,
Ms.
Spencer
said
,
workers
reasoned
that
it
was
perhaps
time
to
give
the
new
owner
some
maneuvering
room
and
themselves
another
chance
at
higher
pay
.
A
visitor
recently
found
plant
employees
toiling
at
a
seemingly
leisurely
pace
along
conveyor
belts
that
carry
chickens
and
chicken
parts
through
the
chilly
room
,
kept
at
50
degrees
.
In
the
last
18
months
,
the
plant
has
installed
mechanized
deboning
machines
that
flay
82
thigh
and
breasts
pieces
a
minute
.
The
plant
has
none
of
the
storied
,
Dickensian-feel
of
some
other
plants
where
workers
with
knives
stand
shoulder-to-shoulder
at
the
assembly
line
,
cutting
,
eviscerating
,
deboning
and
marinating
chicken
parts
at
breakneck
speed
.
Wages
went
up
to
$
6.60
an
hour
,
up
from
$
6.25
an
hour
in
August
,
just
after
Tyson
bought
the
plant
.
Wayne
B.
Butler
,
who
manages
Tyson
's
Canton
plant
and
three
others
,
said
:
``
People
in
the
industry
in
times
gone
by
who
have
unions
have
deserved
them
because
they
did
n't
know
how
to
treat
their
people

came
on

only

FRAMINGHAM
,
Mass.
--
Five
years
ago
the
Sealtest
and
Breyers
ice
cream
plant
here
was
being
called
by
its
general
manager
``
a
dinosaur
,
doomed
to
extinction
.
''
Although
just
25
years
old
,
the
landmark
plant
alongside
the
Massaschusetts
Turnpike
was
antiquated
by
food
industry
standards
.
And
today
this
plant
is
undergoing
a
$
6
million
expansion
funded
by
new
owners
,
Good
Humor-Breyers
Ice
Cream
Co.
,
a
division
of
Dutch-based
Unilever
NV
,
and
has
a
bright
future
.
Along
with
new
freezers
and
warehousing
and
milk-storage
capacity
,
these
improvements
will
lift
this
plant
's
annual
production
capacity
to
60
million
gallons
--
nearly
three
times
its
present
output
.
That
,
according
to
Crowley
,
who
still
runs
the
place
,
is
the
highest
volume
of
any
ice
cream
plant
in
the
country
.
All
this
is
welcomed
in
a
town
hit
hard
in
recent
years
by
computer
company
layoffs
and
the
1989
closure
of
a
General
Motors
assembly
plant
.
Framingham
's
windfall
came
at
a
price
--
the
closure
of
a
Good
Humor-Breyers
plant
in
Philadelphia
,
where
240
persons
were
laid
off
.
The
saga
begins
in
1990
,
when
Crowley
convinced
top
managers
at
Kraft
General
Foods
,
now
a
subsidiary
of
Philip
Morris
Cos
.
,
that
his
plant
could
survive
if
it
could
be
made
more
efficient
.
That
decision
was
made
possible
because
the
plant
's
electric
utility
,
Boston
Edison
Co.
,
saw
itself
in
danger
of
losing
one
of
its
largest
customers
,
then
was
paying
an
annual
electric
bill
of
$
1.4
million
--
and
state
officials
,
alerted
to
this
risk
,
got
worried
as
well
about
the
jobs
that
would
vanish
.
The
plant
's
electric
bill
fell
by
$
500,000
in
the
first
year
after
the
work
was
completed
--
and
productivity
soon
doubled
,
from
a
previous
output
level
of
10
million
gallons
.
The
Philadelphia
plant
--
located
in
the
city
where
the
Breyers
label
had
its
start
,
was
the
oldest
,
least
efficient
,
and
the
first
to
go
,
along
with
a
small
plant
in
Los
Angeles
.
The
Los
Angeles
operations
moved
to
an
existing
plant
in
Nevada
.
Another
plant
in
Huntington
,
Ind
.
,
got
a
small
part
of
the
former
Philadephia
business
.
As
part
of
an
informal
agreement
with
the
state
Office
of
Business
Development
,
which
helped
expedite
permits
that
were
needed
for
the
expansion
,
the
Framingham
plant
has
hired
most
of
its
new
emloyees
through
the
local
unemployment
office
.
Despite
red-tape
glitches
,
the
plant
's
expansion
seems
to
have
few
if
any
foes
.
State
agricultural
officials
and
managers
at
Agri-Mark
Inc.
,
of
Methuen
,
a
farmer
cooperative
that
is
the
plant
's
main
supplier
,
applaud
this
growth
.
Economic
development
leaders
also
point
out
that
this
is
an
``
export
''
plant
,
shipping
most
of
its
output
out
of
state
and
bringing
dollars
in
.
And
then
there
are
the
plant
's
employees
who
,
averaging
nearly
18
years
in
their
jobs
,
used
to
fear
for
their
futures
.
As
Michael
Sabourin
,
a
veteran
production-line
employee
at
the
plant
went
out
of
his
way
to
say
to
a
visitor
last
week
,
``
They
turned
the
place
around
.
He
said
the
power
plant
was
``
one
of
the
most
reliable
engines
in
service
.
''
The
Republican-backed
package
grants
farmers
wide
latitude
to
plant
crops
according
to
market
prices
instead
of
government
programs
.
Daschle
said
Democrats
were
planning
other
major
amendments
today
,
including
one
to
require
that
farmers
plant
crops
to
qualify
for
federal
subsidies
.
In
October
,
it
opened
a
plant
in
Shanghai
for
making
circuit
boards
used
in
conventional
cameras

SENATE
APPROVES
BILL
PHASING
OUT
FARM
SUBSIDIES
The
Senate
approved
far-reaching
legislation
that
would
end
Depression-era
programs
that
pay
farmers
not
to
plant
and
would
replace
many
crop
subsidies
with
fixed
payments
that
would
decline
over
seven
years
.
The
60-inch
pipe
is
a
primary
conduit
from
the
company
's
filtration
plant
that
draws
water
from
the
Oradell
Reservoir
,
and
its
failure
forced
the
water
company
to
shut
down
the
main
pipe
,
which
sends
water
from
the
plant
to
the
rest
of
the
system
.
After
the
company
shut
down
the
72-inch
main
,
it
shifted
the
water
to
an
old
,
48-inch
pipe
leading
out
of
the
filtration
plant
.
As

neighbors
of
a
Buda
cement
plant
that
is
testing
the
use
of
tires
for
fuel
.
The
plant
's
decision
to
switch

has
angered
some

who
say
they
had
little
notice

have
been
given
little
information

the
effects

the

It
involves
renovation
of

430,000-square-foot
part
of
the
plant
of
the
former
United

Corp.
,
manufacturers

According
to
a
state
report
released
last
year
,
its
silicone
factory
at
Waterford
caused
more
toxic
ground
pollution
than
any
other
plant
in
the
state
for
the
seventh
straight
year

One
is
the
allegation
,
supported
by
DEC
internal
memorandums
,
that
the
company
threatened
to
take
its
planned
expansion
of
the
Waterford
plant
elsewhere
if
a
large
fine
was
levied
.
The
location
nearly
clicked

towers
over
the
rugged
,
strangely
remote
area
of
iced-over
marshes
and
misshapen
industrial
back
lots
that
form
the
border
between
Secaucus
and
Jersey
City

observation
sent
all
of
the
patrol
cars
spinning
toward
New

,
where
the
train
tracks
curl
toward

City
and
the

new
plant
is

to
employ
about
150
people
in
the
first
few
years

revolutionize
food
shopping
for
New
Yorkers
,
long
used
to
cramped
corner
stores
and
scaled-down
supermarkets

Robert

by
a
joint-venture
agreement
to
purchase
the
vacant
GM
plant
for
an
undisclosed
amount

moved
to
where
the

plant
is
.
''
Selleck
said
when
the
plant
closed
in
1992
,
he
hated
to
see
the
land
stand
empty
because
he
could
envision
how
it
could
revitalize
his
Van
Nuys
neighborhood
and
the
Valley
beyond
.
``
I
ca
n't
think
of

But
despite
their
concern
over
the
GM
plant
,
the
Sellecks
said
they
did
n't
actively
pursue
the
property
,
because
they
were
concentrating
on
developing
shopping
centers
around
the
San
Fernando
Valley
and
in

Palmdale
,
Lancaster
and
Ventura
County
.
He
recounted
the
strong
impression
a
sixth-grade
field
trip
to
the
plant
made
upon
him
,
as
one
example
.
``
What
sticks
out
is
how
awestruck
we
all
were
and
how
large
the

was

Huggins
recalls
how

Paso
Robles
grower
,
would
drive
a
flatbed
truck
with
150-pound
bags
of
almonds
to
the
Los

plant
.
Despite
strict
specifications
,
employees
at

South
San

plant
still
sift
through
all
nuts
,
picking
out
any

The

fell
after

said
yesterday
that
it
was
re-evaluating
its
agreement
to
pump
$
355
million
into
Digital
Equipment
's
semiconductor
plant
in
Hudson
.
The
agreement
would
mean
that
Digital
Equipment
could
operate
the
under-used
Hudson
plant
at
full
capacity
.
The
company
has
completed
a
reorganization
of
the
business
,
which
included
plant
closings
,
firings
and
revamping
of
some
product
lines
.
The

expressed

``

,
''
said
Robert
E.
Caldwell
,
head
of
Digital
Semiconductor
,
which
oversees
the
Hudson
plant
.
The
plant
was
built
for
Digital
's
ultrafast
Alpha
microprocessor
,
which
the
Maynard-based
computer
maker
believed
would
become
an
industry
standard
.
Digital
sunk
an
estimated
$
500
million
into
the
factory
,
but
the
chip
has
not
yet
been
widely
adopted
;
as
a
result
,
the
Hudson
plant
is
now
running
at
an
estimated
35
percent
capacity
.
Under
the
original
agreement
,
Cirrus
was
to
invest
$
355
million
in
cash
and
lease
financing
designed
to
bring
the
plant
up
to
capacity
.
``
The
improvement
that
they
would
have
enjoyed
-LRB-
with
the
plant
operating
at
capacity
-RRB-
is
looking
a
lot
less
likely
,
''
said
Gary
Helmig
,
an
analysts
with
the
SoundView
Financial
Group
.
The
Hudson
plant
was
not
expected
to
boost
1996
earnings
,
which
Helmig
estimates
will
be
at
$
3.55
per
share
.
Still
,
Helmig
said
the
failure
to
bring
the
plant
up
to
capacity
will
not
prove
fatal
for
Digital
.
Council
members
also
heralded
the
solid-waste
management
plan
as
a
major
environmental
victory
because
it
sets
up
a
major
obstacle
to
the
building
of
the
Brooklyn
Navy
Yard
incinerator
by
calling
for
a
new
environmental
review
of
the
proposed
plant
.
He
also
emphasized
the
significance
of
the
incinerator
measure
,
which
delays
the
plant
's
construction
from
1996
until
1999
by
requiring
the
city
to
do
a
study
on
the
environmental
impact
the
incinerator
would
have
on
surrounding
communities
.
But
incinerator
opponents
said
on
Thursday
that
they
were
confident
that
a
new
study
would
effectively
kill
construction
plans
because
it
would
prove
that
emissions
from
the
proposed
plant
would
create
health
hazards
in
Williamsburg
and
Greenpoint
in
Brooklyn
and
on
the
Lower
East
Side
of
Manhattan
.
Its
latest
expansion
plans

follow
large
capacity-boosting

Wolf
Creek
nuclear
power
plant
operators
erred
when
they
failed
to
declare
an
``
alert
''
during
recent
icing
problems
,
and
the
plant
must
remain
closed
until
the
problems
are
fixed
,
federal
regulators
said
Thursday
.
The
earliest
the
plant
can
reopen
is
April
,
when
a
normally
scheduled
refueling
is
completed
.
Because
the
problems
reached
``
alert
''
levels
,
they
are
considered
the
most
serious
ever
at
the
10-year-old
plant
.
Federal
officials
and
Wolf
Creek
operators
met
Thursday
for
more
than
an
hour
at
a
special
public
meeting
at
the
plant
,
located
90
miles
southwest
of
Kansas
City
.
However
,
both
regulators
and
Wolf
Creek
officials
emphasized
that
the
public
was
not
in
danger
during
the
36-hour
period
at
the
plant
,
and
other
cooling
methods
could
have
been
called
on
if
needed
.
The
operating
corporation
runs
the
plant
on
behalf
of
its
owners
,
a
group
of
area
utilities
.
Wolf
Creek
declared
a
``
notification
of
unusual
event
,
''
the
least
serious
accident
classification
,
on
Jan.
30
when
ice
blocked
the
flow
of
water
from
Wolf
Creek
's
5,000-acre
cooling
lake
into
the
plant
.
Complicating
the
issue
now
are
problems
with
the
control
rods
discovered
when
the
plant
shut
down
because
of
the
icing
.
The
rods
are
essential
for
stopping
the
nuclear
reaction
process
when
the
plant
is
shut
down
.
The
$
3.05
billion
plant
,
the
largest
construction
project
ever
in
Kansas
,
will
not
be
allowed
to
resume
operation
until
regulators
are
convinced
that
problems
with
the
rods
in
the
reactor
core
have
been
fixed
,
Callan
said
.
But
during
the
bitter
cold
of
late
January
,
the
water
became
super-chilled
,
and
microscopic
bits
of
ice
began
forming
on
the
plant
equipment
below
the
surface
of
the
lake
.
Federal
regulators
in
1989
sent
a
letter
to
nuclear
power
plant
operators
describing
such
a
potential
problem
.
Federal
regulators
also
are
concerned
about
the
failure
of
five
control
rods
to
fully
descend
into
the
reactor
fuel
bundles
for
a
brief
period
when
the
plant
was
shut
down
Jan.
30
.
Nix
also
suggests
installing

said
its
net
loss
almost
trebled
in

fell
and
it
took
a
charge
to
revalue

reduce

costs
in

.
In
the
face

revalued

,
while
land
and
buildings
are
now
shown
at
their
acquisition
values
,
the

said
at
a
press
conference
.
The
basic
facts
seem
simple
:
the
Everglades
once
stretched
from
Lake
Okeechobee
to
Florida
Bay
,
covering
about
4,000
square
miles
with
a
thin

flowing
water
that
sustained
an
incredible

was
sold

love

but
this
does
not
alter
the
pest
nature
of
this
plant
a
bit
.
We
all
make
mistakes
of
plant
selection
and
placement
now
and
then
.
I
've
learned
to
do
some
research
before
selecting
large
landscape
plants
,
but
I
sometimes
make
mistakes
on
smaller
plants
because
growth
habit
is
n't
on
my
mind
when
buying
the
plant
.
As
my
landscape
and
garden
reach
the
supersaturation
point
in
plants
,
I
've
refined
my
priorities
in
plant
selection
.
Consequently
and
inevitably
,
I
came
to

the

Still

,
only

build
digital

,
a

The

Clinton
also
used
his

underscore
the

set
himself
apart
from
the

who
has
appealed

at
the

began
a

at

Friday

the

barely
reacted

brightening
with
enthusiasm

praised

JURAGUA
,
Cuba
--
From
the
day
the
Cuban
government
began
building
an
atomic
reactor
here
in
the
early
1980s
,
American
officials
were
alarmed
at
the
prospect
that
a
nuclear
power
plant
of
Soviet
design
and
questionable
safety
would
be
going
into
operation
less
than
200
miles
from
American
shores
,
but
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it
.
Completion
of
the
mothballed
plant
hinges
on
many
factors
,
not
the
least
of
which
is
raising
so
much
money
during
a
period
of
severe
economic
austerity
both
here
and
in
Russia
.
Rather
,
American
officials
have
repeatedly
expressed
concerns
about
the
safety
of
the
plant
here
,
which
uses
an
updated
version
of
the
VVER-440
Soviet
design
found
in
Eastern
Europe
.
Located
in
a
rural
sugar-growing
area
of
the
central
province
of
Cienfuegos
,
the
Juragua
plant
lies
260
miles
south
of
Miami
.
The
smaller
Juragua
plant
is
a
pressurized
water
reactor
,
rather
than
one
that
uses
graphite
,
and
has
additional
safety
features
including
a
secondary
containment
dome
.
Cuba
has
also
decided
to
equip
the
plant
with
Western-made
controls
and
instruments
,
since
the
original
control
system
no
longer
meets
Russian
safety
standards
.
Harold
Denton
,
the
former
director
of
the
Office
of
International
Programs
of
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
,
is
one
of
the
few
American
officials
to
have
visited
the
plant
.
Because
the
Juragua
plant
raises
security
concerns
,
he
said
,
``
we
ought
to
bend
the
rules
a
little
bit
''
regarding
the
embargo
``
and
allow
cooperation
on
safety
matters
.
''
In
an
effort
to
reduce
American
uncertainty
about
its
nuclear
program
,
Cuba
let
two
American
delegations
visit
the
plant
this
month
and
meet
with
Cuban
government
officials
.
The
head
of
the
Cuban
government
's
nuclear
regulatory
agency
promised
that
he
would
not
succumb
to
any
political
pressure
to
finish
the
plant
.
``
Until
it
is
proven
from
all
points
of
view
that
our
facility
has
the
same
degree
of
safety
as
those
in
the
rest
of
the
world
,
this
plant
will
not
be
granted
a
license
,
''
said
Fidel
Santana
,
director
of
the
National
Center
for
Nuclear
Safety
.
But
they
also
indicated
that
they
saw
alternative
energy
sources
as
an
eventual
complement
to
the
nuclear
power
plant
,
not
as
an
immediate
substitute
.
``
Nobody
is
more
interested
in
not
having
to
build
this
power
plant
than
us
,

said
Pedro
Miret
,
a
vice
president
of
the

executive

WASHINGTON
--
Libya
is
close
to
completing
the
world
's
largest
underground
chemical
weapons
plant
in
a
hollowed-out
mountain
40
miles
southeast
of
Tripoli
,
U.S.
intelligence
services
say
.
The
subterranean
plant
may
be
completed
in
1997
or
1998
and
is
said
to
cover
six
square
miles
.
If
it
goes
into
operation
,
the
plant
will
be
able
to
produce
the
ingredients
for
tons
of
poison
gas
a
day
,
intelligence
officials
said
.
Though
the
CIA
has
not
been
able
to
photograph
the
plant
,
German
intelligence
services
have
obtained
copies
of
construction
plans
and
building
specifications
.
The
German
services
obtained
them
from
a
number
of
German
and
Austrian
companies
,
which
sent
construction
personnel
and
equipment
to
help
build
the
tunnel
for
the
plant
.
Deutch
briefly
mentioned
the
Libyan
site
,
which
he
called
``
the
world
's
largest
underground
chemical
weapons
plant
,
''
in
testimony
delivered
Thursday
before
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
.
It
built
a
weapons
plant
at
Rabta
,
southwest
of
Tripoli
,
with
the
assistance
of
German
companies
.
That
plant
,
which
Libya
said
was
a
factory
for
pharmaceuticals
,
made
an
estimated
100
tons
of
chemical
weapons
,
said
a
former
director
of
Central
Intelligence
,
Robert
M.
Gates
.
After
the
United
States
accused
Libya
of
making
chemical
weapons
at
Rabta
,
the
Libyans
said
the
plant
had
been
destroyed
by
a
fire
set
by
Western
intelligence
agents
in
1990
.
The
CIA
says
the
fire
was
a
hoax
that
has
allowed
Libya
to
evade
international
inspection
,
clean
up
the
plant
,
convert
it
to
a
legitimate
pharmaceutical
plant
and
build
the
new
underground
chemical
weapons
complex
at
Tarhunah
.
The
CIA
publicly
estimates
that
the
new
plant
will
be
completed
``
late
in
this
decade
.

Thousands
of
lawsuits
seeking
damages
from
General
Public
Utility
Corp.
for
the
1979
accident
at
its
Three
Mile
Island
nuclear
power
plant
can
proceed
,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
ruled
today
.
The
high
court
refused
to
consider
GPU
's
argument
that
people
who
lived
or
worked
near
the
plant
must
be
required
to
prove
--before
trial
--
that
they
were
each
exposed
to
excessive
radiation
.
The
lower
court
said
it
was
enough
for
neighbors
of
the
nuclear
plant
to
show
that
the
accident
almost
17
years
ago
released
enough
radiation
to
violate
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
rules
on
radiation
emissions
,
as
measured
at
the
power
plant
's
borders
.
GPU
appealed
,
saying
that
standard
is
far
too
lenient
and
could
threaten
to
hold
the
nuclear
power
industry
liable
to
almost
anybody
who
develops
cancer
while
living
near
a
nuclear
power
plant
.
The
utility
argued
that
radiation
measurements
at
the
edge
of
the
plant
are
irrelevant
.
Millions
of
Americans
get
cancer
every
year
,
GPU
said
,
and
nuclear
power
plant
operators
could
be
vulnerable
to
waves
of
groundless
claims
if
people
who
live
near
nuclear
plants
can
try
to
blame
their
diseases
on
radiation
,
without
any
proof
they
were
actually
exposed
to
dangerous
levels
.
persons
working
at
or
residing
within
some
radius
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
,
if
they
received
any
exposure
whatsoever
from
that
plant
.
In
the
aftermath
of
the
accident
,
Three
Mile
Island
's
neighbors
filed
more
than
2,000
lawsuits
against
GPU
and
other
companies
involved
in
design
and
construction
of
the
plant
,
including
McDermott

Inc.

Co.
,
Raytheon
Co.

,
and

Ten
test
cases
,
involving
claims
that
the
accident
's
radiation
release
caused
cancer
,
have
been
selected
for
trial
.
There
's
no
dispute
that
the
accident
released
more
radiation
than
NRC
rules
allow
,
as
measured
by
monitors
at
the
nuclear
plant
's
boundaries
.
Emissions
outside
the
plant
boundaries
are
limited
to
500
millirems
a
year
.
The
appeals
court
said
,
however
,
that
at
the
pre-trial
stage
the
lawsuit
plaintiffs
only
needed
to
show
that
the
Three
Mile
Island
accident
released
more
than
500
millirems
from
the
plant
site
,
without
any
evidence
about
their
actual
exposure

NEW
YORK
--
Barnard
College
resembled
an
auto
plant
far
more
than
an
ivory
tower
Monday
as
dozens
of
striking
workers
carried
picket
signs
and
blew
whistles
to
protest
a
management
demand
that
they
contribute
to
health-insurance
premiums
.
The

said
it

Workers
hired

the
plant
will
be
offered
jobs
at
Micron

operations
in
Boise
,
Micron
said
.
The
plant
was
originally
projected
to
cost
$
1.3
billion
to
build
.
It
settled
a
related
suit
last
June
,
pleading
guilty
to
15
criminal
counts
and
agreeing
to
pay
up
to
$
9
million
to
the
government
for
damages
involving
its
plant
in
Mineral
Wells
,
Texas
,
which
has
since
closed
.
Last
June
,
the
company
said
that
former
employees
at
the
Mineral
Wells
plant
had
acted
in
violation
of
company
policy
.
Two
former
employees
at
the
plant
,
Stanley
L.
Bowlin
,
a
quality
control
manager
,
and
Victor
K.
Paulsen
,
an

,
pleaded
guilty
at
that
time
to
conspiring
to
defraud
the
government
.

,
the

plant
community
,
earning
it
a
designation

Since
the
coastal
sage
scrub
melds

CLEARWATER
,
S.C.
--
Conservative
commentator
Pat
Buchanan
stood
in
front
of
a
closed
textile
plant
Wednesday
and
told
workers
who
had
once
been
employed
there
that
U.S.
trade
policies
have
``
sent
jobs
of
American
workers
overseas
.
''
Later
,
Sen
.
Bob
Dole
mingled
with
workers
in
the
German-owned
BMW
auto
assembly
plant
in
Greer
,
S.C.
,
to
show
his
support
for
free
trade
.
Buchanan
selected
a
plant
that
was
forced
to
close
in
1988
because
of
foreign
competition
.
With
television
cameras
taping
the
grim
industrial
backdrop
,
Buchanan
pointed
to
the
closed
factory
and
said
:
``
That
's
what
happened
to
this
plant
.
Dole
spoke
at
the
$
600
million
BMW
plant
the
day
after
the
firm
announced
plans
to
invest
$
200
million
to
increase
production
capacity
from
300
to
400
cars
per
day
and
employ
2,000
people
by
the
end
of
the
decade
,
up
from
1,700
jobs
now
.

Under
Bingaman
's
plan
,
corporations
would
also
have
to
pay
their
bosses
no
more
than
50
times
as
much
as
their
lowest-paid
worker
,
put
at
least
half
their
new
investment
in
research
and
development
,
keep
90
percent
of

records
.
On
Wednesday
,
Buchanan
outlined
his
protectionist
trade
policies
at
a
shuttered
South
Carolina
textile
plant
.
Buchanan
was
fired
up
as
he
spoke
to
supporters
in
a
pouring
rain
Wednesday
outside
a
closed
apparel
finishing
plant
in
Clearwater
,
S.C.
He
urged
the
crowd
to
ignore
``
all
those
names
''
he
is
being
called
.
During

campaign
stop
Wednesday
at
a

that
the
German
car-maker
BMW
opened

Carolina
Piedmont
,
Dole
refused
to
bite
when
asked
to
respond
to
Buchanan
's
allegation
that
he
is
``
the
bellhop
of
the
business
roundtable

``

said

CLINTON
,
S.C.
--
With
red
lipstick
from
farewell
kisses
still
smeared
across
both
cheeks
,
Todd
E.
Alexander
worked
his
last
shift
at
Clinton
Mills
Industries
'
Lydia
plant
,
a
hulking
old
textile
mill
that
plans
to
shut
its
doors
in
April
.
``
The
main
thing
is
that
he
's
not
a
protectionist
,
''
Rankin
said
,
citing
the
Fuji
plant
here
and
its
plans
for
expansion
.
There
are
problems
in
our
rural
communities
where
they
've
seen
plant
closures
.
He
laces
his
speeches
with
references
to
textile
mill
closings
,
including
the
Lydia
plant
here
in
Clinton
,
and
rails
against
``
corporate
butchers
who
no
longer
feel
a
deep
sense
of
loyalty
to
their
employees
.
''
Foreign
competition
is
only
part
of
the
reason
that
Clinton
Mills
Industries
is
closing
its
Lydia
plant
,
where
cloth
has
been
loomed
since
1902
.
``
Imports
have
affected
that
plant
significantly
,
''
said
A.
Michael
Hopp
,
a
company
vice
president
.
And
that
plant
was
our
oldest
plant
and
had
the
oldest
technology
.
''
Kenny
E.
Brock
,
a
42-year-old
electrician
who
came
to
work
at
the
Lydia
plant
two
years
ago
in
search
of
job
security
,
said
he
was
likely
to
vote
for
Buchanan
because
``
he
wants
to
limit
the
imports
and
the
foreign
cloth
and
stuff
like
that
so
we
'll
have
some
work
instead
of
Korea
and
Mexico
getting
all
of
it
.
''
David
E.
Satterfield
,
a
34-year-old
air-conditioning
technician
who
has
worked
at
the
plant
for
12
years
,
said
he
would
choose
between
Buchanan
and
Dole
.
At
the
time
,
Anheuser-Busch
said
it
would
close
the
Cape
Cod
plant
if
a
buyer
was
n't
found
in
60
days
.
Wednesday
,
Bernard
was
greeted
by
a
poster
over
the
plant
's
retail
store
that
read
,
``
Cape
Cod
Potato
Chips
Thanks
Steve
Bernard
.
The
United
States
stopped
making
pits
when
the
Rocky
Flats
plant
,
in
a
suburb
of
Denver
,
was
shut
down
in
1992
because
of
safety
problems
.
Buchanan
went
to
a
shuttered
textile
mill
and
blamed
the
closure
on
a
trade
deal
,
while
Dole
went
to
a
BMW
automobile
plant
and
said
trade
creates
US
jobs
.
At
that
moment
,
Dole
,
who
came
in
second
in
Arizona
,
was
preparing
to
tour
a
BMW
automobile
plant
to
underscore
the
benefits
of
free
trade
.
He
traveled
the
world
as
governor
,
seeking
investors
and
personally
negotiating
deals
that
brought
a
BMW
car
plant
to
the
outskirts
of
Greenville
,
where
Dole
spoke
on
Wednesday
afternoon
,
and
the
Fuji
Photo
plant
to
Greenwood
.
But
on
Wednesday
afternoon
,
inside
the
immaculately
white
BMW
plant
in
Greenville
,
Dole
mumbled
a
few
phrases
about
free
trade
,
then
stepped
aside
and
let
Campbell
,
Gov.
David
Beasley
and
Sen
.
Phil
Gramm
of
Texas
,
his
erstwhile
rival
,
speak
for
him
.
Under
its
plan
,
the
Long
Island
Power
Authority
would
assume
$
6.75
billion
of
LILCO
debt
,
mostly
for
the
never-opened
Shoreham
nuclear
power
plant
.
In
the
1970s
and
'80s
,
protests
rose
against
the
Shoreham
plant
over
its
cost
,
which
spiraled
20-fold
,
and
its
safety
.
``
Somebody
once
said
you
could
use
the
Shoreham
plant
as
a
retirement
residence
for
all
the
people
who
were
either
elected
or
defeated
because
of
it
,
''
said
Irving
Like
,
a
lawyer
and
longtime
LILCO
critic
.
But
some
of
that
reflected
Suffolk
's
overassessments
on
the
Shoreham
plant
.

The
Venezuelan
government
postponed
talks
with
the
International
Monetary
Fund
on
$
3
billion
loan
after
Congress
failed
to
pass
tax
proposals
that
would
let
the
government
negotiate
the
loan
's
terms

Photographing

it

The

French
automaker
PSA
Peugeot
Citroen
said
it
has
conducted
in-depth
studies
on
building
an
automobile
plant
in
Brazil
to
manufacture
its
Citroen
brand
of
cars
,
Brazil
's
O
Globo
newspaper
reported
.
A
decision
could
come
soon
on
building
a
plant
that
would
need
at
least
$
500
million
in
investments
and
take
three
years
to
be
in
production
,
said
Bernard
Terquem
,
a
Citroen
director
responsible
for
sales
outside
of
France
.
``
It
does
n't
make
sense
to
build
a
$
50
million
plant
in
Brazil
.
''
After
an
Italian
Supreme
Court
order
led
to
patent
protection
there
in
1979
,
jobs
and
plant
investments
increased
.
Only
35
percent
of
those
who
were
laid
off
in
1991
and
1992
as
a
result
of
plant
closings
had
found
other
jobs
with
equal
pay
by
1994
,
the
last
year
for
which
figures
are
available
,
according
to
Jeremy
Rifkin
,
president
of
the
Foundation
on
Economic
Trends
and
author
of
``
The
End
of
Work
.
''
Moreover
,
there
is
scant
evidence
that
the
1
million
jobs
lost
on
average
each
year
because
of
plant
closings
are
caused
by
the
flight
of
jobs
overseas
.
After

Alexander
contrasted
his
faith
in
the
``
New
South
''
with
what
he
said
were
Buchanan
's
regressive
policies
.
The
centerpiece
of
the
overall
bill
rests
on
provisions
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
would
abolish
the
link
between
what
farmers
plant
and
how
much
the
government
pays
them
.
Large
Midwestern
farms
support
such
an
approach
because
it
gives
them
broader
leeway
in
deciding
when
to
plant
,
what
to
plant
and
how
much
to
plant
.
Of
those
,
12
are
on
family
farms
and
only
six
are
considered
large
--
the
Hood
plant
in
Agawam
,
Garelick
Farms
in
Franklin
,
West
Lynn
Creamery
in
Lynn
,
the
Stop
&
Shop
dairy
in
Readville
and
Cumberland
Farms
bottling
plants
in
Canton
and
Westborough
.
But
that
effort
``
fell
through
at
the
10th
hour
,
''
said
John
Regan
,
director
of
the
state
Office
of
Business
Development
,
and
Kaneb
's
purchase
seemed
to
affirm
that
the
plant
was
doomed
.
Never
mind
that
Richard
Gephardt
had
stood
before
the
same
textile
plant
,
preaching
protectionism
in
his
failed
effort
to
win
the
Democratic
nomination
in
1988
.
He
made
his
pitch
at
a
gleaming

Thousands
of
lawsuits
seeking
damages
from
General
Public
Utility
Corp.
for
the
1979
accident
at
its
Three
Mile
Island
nuclear
power
plant
can
proceed
,
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
ruled
today
.
The
high
court
refused
to
consider
GPU
's
argument
that
people
who
lived
or
worked
near
the
plant
must
be
required
to
prove
--before
trial
--
that
they
were
each
exposed
to
excessive
radiation
.
The
lower
court
said
it
was
enough
for
neighbors
of
the
nuclear
plant
to
show
that
the
accident
almost
17
years
ago
released
enough
radiation
to
violate
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
rules
on
radiation
emissions
,
as
measured
at
the
power
plant
's
borders
.
GPU
appealed
,
saying
that
standard
is
far
too
lenient
and
could
threaten
to
hold
the
nuclear
power
industry
liable
to
almost
anybody
who
develops
cancer
while
living
near
a
nuclear
power
plant
.
The
utility
argued
that
radiation
measurements
at
the
edge
of
the
plant
are
irrelevant
.
Millions
of
Americans
get
cancer
every
year
,
GPU
said
,
and
nuclear
power
plant
operators
could
be
vulnerable
to
waves
of
groundless
claims
if
people
who
live
near
nuclear
plants
can
try
to
blame
their
diseases
on
radiation
,
without
any
proof
they
were
actually
exposed

dangerous
levels
.

or

some
radius
of

plant
.
In
the
aftermath
of
the
accident
,
Three

Island
's
neighbors
filed
more
than
2,000
lawsuits
against
GPU
and

Ten

involving
claims
that

There
's
no
dispute
that
the

released
more
radiation
than

by

at
the

Bobby
Hitt
,
the

spokesman
,
explained
that
BMW
chose
Greer
over
200
other
sites
for
the
plant
for
two
reasons
--
the
availability
of
workers
,
and
a
desire
to
build
good
will
in
the
company
's
largest
market
outside

occur

In
a
large
field
study
of
prairie
plants
,
a
team
of
biologists
found
that
the
more
species
a
plot
had
,
the
more
``
biomass
,
''
or
plant
material
,
it
produced
and
the
better
it
retained
nitrogen
,
its
most
crucial
nutrient
.
In
the
second
year
,
each
plot
was
examined
to
estimate
how
much
growth
there
had
been
--
the
total
plant
biomass
--
and
how
the
plot

plants
had
used
the
available
nitrogen
.
The
idea
is
that
the
more
species
there
are
on

plot
of
land
,
the
more
efficiently
those
many
species
,
all
slightly
different
,
can
utilize
the
resources
present

thereby
producing
more

plant
mass

In

designed
to
study
the
effects
of
nitrogen

competition

that
plots
with

Sharlow
his

contracts

in
a
land
where
it
never
snowed

Northridge
plant

Kodak
,
he
increased
net
profit
by
10
percent
in
his
first
year
and
by
19
percent
his
second
.
The
plant
was
shut
down
as
a
cost-cutting
measure
,
part
of
an
industry-wide
slowdown
caused
by
the
melting
cold
war

pushed
